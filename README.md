# soflyco

This project is a few years old and no longer being actively developed. While it was running, it tracked Alaska Airlines itinerary prices and notified users when prices dropped so they could claim a refund, specifically after purchase. I left it in a precarious state and intended to do a complete refactor, but mainly used the project to learn Flask and Mongo, and was focused on making it function. I used it for a year and saved $1400 while it was operating.
