# soflyco

This project is a few years old and no longer being actively developed. While it was running, it tracked Alaska Airlines itinerary prices and notified users when prices dropped so they could claim a refund, specifically even after purchase. I left it in a sloppy state and inteded to do a complete refactor, but I used the project to learn Flask and focused on making it function. I personally saved $1400 on flights over the year it was operating.
